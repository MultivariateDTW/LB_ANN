# LB_ANN
LB_ANN is a novel lower-bound function for multivariate DTW that uses efficient Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search to compute tight distance bounds. It provides a tighter estimate than existing envelope-based methods, enabling effective sequence pruning and significant acceleration for similarity searches, even without window constraints.
